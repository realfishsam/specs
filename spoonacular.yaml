  title: Spoonacular API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: The Spoonacular Nutrition, Recipe, and Food API allows you to access over 380,000 recipes, thousands of ingredients, 800,000 food products, and 100,000 menu items. Our food ontology and semantic recipe search engine makes it possible to search for recipes using natural language queries, such as "gluten free brownies without sugar" or "low fat vegan cupcakes." You can automatically calculate the nutritional information for any recipe, analyze recipe costs, visualize ingredient lists, find recipes for what's in your fridge, find recipes based on special diets, nutritional requirements, or favorite ingredients, classify recipes into types and cuisines, convert ingredient amounts, or even compute an entire meal plan. With our powerful API, you can create food apps and services that will help your users eat better.

      description: |
        Search through thousands of recipes using advanced filtering and ranking. NOTE: This method combines searching by query, by ingredients, and by nutrients into one endpoint.

        If you are making a "what's in your fridge?" style app and require more filters than the Search Recipes by Ingredients endpoint allows, use the sort parameters max-used-ingredients or min-missing-ingredients with this endpoint instead.
